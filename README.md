while creating the table used the HTML structure and CSS for styling.

## HTML Structure
HTML structure provides the framework of the timetable.
<ul>
  <li>We use the < table > element to represent the table data</li>
  <li>Rows are created with < tr > (table rows) </li>
  <li>Headings like days/time are created usind < th >  or < thead >.</li>
  <li>Data like subjects, break and lunch are placed inside a table data < td ></li>
</ul>
HTML defines content and structure only.

## CSS(style)
CSS is used to improve the appearance of the timetable
<ul>
  <li>Add borders,background colors and spacing.</li>
  <li>Center align texts and heading.</li>
  <li>Differentiate eader cells < th > from normal cells < td ></li>
  <li>Helps in merging cells in rows and columns using rowspan and colspan</li>
</ul>

## Conclusion
HTML bulids the skeleton while the CSS makes it presentable.
Both work together to make a timetable that is functional and visually clear.
